# INFO 340 Project

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

The proposal.html file contains our project proposal. Within this proposal we hope to provide Play It Again Sports with an inhouse booking system and remove their reliance on simply book me as a third-party reservation system. We proposed several features such as the booking system, a ski recommendation algorithm, and a login/account feature. 

The proposal.css file contains styling for the proposal.
